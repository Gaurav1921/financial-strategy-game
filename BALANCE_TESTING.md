# Balance Testing — Joint Ventures & Betrayal Viability

## Method
A strategy tournament, not a spreadsheet guess. 6 archetypes share a pod and
play a season (20 rounds) of forming Joint Ventures (JVs), deciding each
round whether to hold or drain, under our proposed rules. Every parameter
combination was run 500 times (random pairing, random JV duration) and
averaged. Code: `sim/jv_simulation.py`, raw output: `sim/results_baseline.csv`
and `sim/results_reptax.csv`.

**Archetypes tested:**
- **Loyalist** — always holds, partners with anyone (the naive/trusting player).
- **Backstabber** — drains the first chance it gets, partners with anyone.
- **ReputationAware** — never drains, refuses to partner with anyone who's
  ever drained before (zero tolerance).
- **Grudger** — never drains, tolerates one prior offense, refuses after two.
- **Opportunist** — holds normally, but drains pre-emptively against
  bad-reputation partners, and always drains in the final round.
- **EndgameRational** — holds honestly and picks safe partners like
  ReputationAware, but always drains in the final round.

**What was swept:** `DrainBonus` (the % of the pot a drainer keeps — the
core "how tempting is betrayal" dial) from 0.50 to 0.95, and `GrowthRate`
(the % the pot compounds per round while both hold — the "how much does
patience pay" dial) from 0.05 to 0.20.

## Finding 1: the original design (v3, no reputation consequence beyond
partner refusal) breaks down fast
With only "refuse to partner with known offenders" as the punishment,
**blind Backstabber wins outright once DrainBonus reaches ~0.7**, regardless
of growth rate, and even at 0.6 it wins when growth is slow. Refusing to
deal with bad actors just means honest players get fewer opportunities —
it doesn't actually cost the offender enough. This is exactly the collapse
the original "why would anyone ally" critique predicted, and the numbers
confirm it's real, not hypothetical.

## Finding 2: a concrete reputation tax fixes it
Added mechanic, tested as `rep_tax` in the sim: once a player has been
caught draining **2+ times** (publicly visible, matches the GDD's existing
"reputation is visible to the pod" framing), they (a) lose access to safe
idle income — nobody offers them easy deals anymore — and (b) any JV they
still manage to form runs at a **5-percentage-point lower growth rate**
(partners who deal with a known offender anyway protect themselves by
under-investing). This is a small, explainable rule, not a big rewrite.

With it, the "honest strategies win" region expands dramatically — up to
DrainBonus 0.7 across every growth rate tested, and 0.8 in most of them.

## Finding 3: EndgameRational is the strongest honest strategy, consistently
Across almost every viable setting, the best-performing honest archetype
isn't pure Loyalist or strict ReputationAware — it's **EndgameRational**:
play honestly and by-the-reputation-book all season, then take the
expected defection in the guaranteed final round. This directly confirms
the GDD's Section 4.6 design intent (the final round is deliberately
different, and rational endgame defection is a feature, not a flaw) with
actual numbers, not just game-theory citations. It also means onboarding
needs to explicitly teach "the final round works differently" — a player
who stays purely honest through the finale will systematically underperform
players who don't.

## Finding 4: blind trust still gets punished, and betrayal never goes to zero
At high DrainBonus, Loyalist (never checks reputation) consistently posts
the lowest net worth of any strategy — confirms naive trust is a losing
strategy, matching the intended "read your allies or pay for it" tension.
Backstabber's win rate never drops to 0% in any tested setting (it stays a
real, occasionally-winning strategy, typically 5–30% in the recommended
range below) — betrayal remains genuinely tempting, it's just not the
dominant strategy anymore.

## Recommended numbers (with reputation tax enabled)

| Parameter | Recommended value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Joint Venture drain bonus | **65%** (drainer keeps 65% of pot, partner gets 35%) | Comfortably inside the honest-favorable zone (0.6–0.7 all favor honest play with the tax on) while still being a meaningfully large temptation over a fair 50/50 split |
| Joint Venture growth rate | **12%/round held** | Mid-point of the tested range where patience clearly outpaces smash-and-grab; below ~10% patience stops paying off fast enough |
| Reputation tax threshold | **2 proven drains** | Matches Grudger's one-offense tolerance in the model; harsh enough to bite, not so harsh a single mistake ends a player |
| Reputation tax penalty | **–5 percentage points growth rate** on any JV a repeat offender still finds, **no idle income** while ostracized | Smallest penalty that flipped the outcome in testing — no need to go harsher |
| Final round | **Mechanically distinct**, defection there should be expected/telegraphed to players | EndgameRational's edge over pure-honest strategies is real and consistent — the tutorial should say so explicitly rather than let players discover it the hard way |

## What this doesn't cover yet
- Syndicate Move support-threshold math (the takeover mechanic) — not
  simulated yet, same rigor still owed there.
- Hidden Raider role's effect on these numbers — this tournament assumed
  everyone shares the same win condition (net worth). Raiders whose
  incentives differ could shift the equilibrium and haven't been tested.
- Real players aren't fixed strategies — they adapt mid-season. This
  validates the rules are sound in principle, not that human play will
  feel exactly like this.
